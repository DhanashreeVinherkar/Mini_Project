Created a data set containing records of courses including its courseId, Time duration required for the course, price and number of lectures per course. This data set is used to study and analyse the course management like segregating the number of courses by maximum and minimum time,finding specific course details by its courseId,counting the number of courses by the same subject,or we can also add and remove courses by its courseId, etc.
